        CHALLENGE 2: Event Excitement

                Check out this page for a list of all events you can respond to or watch with Javascript:
                https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp

                This "challenge" is a bunch of mini-challenges based on some of the events you can use from that page. 
                If you get stuck on one, leave it & try another. Come back to tricky challenges later.
                Good luck!

            2.1 - Even Milliseconds Spacebar
                The page should tell the user about this game & to press the spacebar.
                The game is this:
                The player has to thold down the spacebar to start the game.
                If they let go of the spacebar when the current time's milliseconds value is an even number, they win. If it's odd, they lose.
                While they hold down the spacebar, cycle through some messages. You could tease them or encourage them.
                While they hold down the spacebar, also show the current time with milliseconds visible. 
                When they let go of the spacebar, tell the user what the current time is & if they won or lost.
                


            2.2 - Save-As Blocker
                The page should prevent right-clicks from opening the context menu. 
                This is useful & important as it's an easy way that you can stop people from saving images (eg. on a professional photography website).



            2.3 - Repeating Random Animations
                This requires a bit of a brush-up on CSS animation. 
                Make a cube on the page. The cube should have these possible animations:
                - moving from the top-left of the page to the top-right
                - moving from the top-right of the page to the top-left
                - moving from the top-left of the page to the bottom-left
                - moving from the top-right of the page to the bottom-right
                - moving from the top-left of the page to the bottom-right
                - moving from the top-right of the page to the bottom-left
                - moving from the bottom-left of the page to the bottom-right
                - moving from the bottom-right of the page to the bottom-left 
                - moving from the bottom-left of the page to the top-right
                - moving from the bottom-right of the page to the top-left 
                - moving from the bottom-left of the page to the top-left
                - moving from the bottom-right of the page to the top-right
                
                The cube should be able to randomly perform any of those animations. It should never ever run out of animations to play.
                There are animation events you can use to trigger a function, and you should be able to call animations from a function.



            2.4 - DIY Trello
                We should all be familiar with Trello by now - we're going to recreate a simple version of it. 

                Start with a good layout from this page:
                https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp

                And use this example of drag/drop event usage as inspiration:
                https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_ondrop 
                And this page for more info:
                https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_ondrop.asp 

                Make a page that uses an input form to create new tasks. 
                New tasks should automatically go to a "backlog" column on the page.
                You should be able to create & name new columns.
                You should be able to drag & drop tasks around the columns.

                Make the page pretty & stylized. No default/non-formatting like in the w3schools example - see how nice Trello looks!
                Maybe each column could be an accordian from Bootstrap? Or a carousel?
