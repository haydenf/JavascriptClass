        CHALLENGE 3: City Skyline HTML/CSS Art Project
            Check out these city skylines here: https://image.freepik.com/free-vector/black-city-skylines_23-2147504628.jpg
            The challenge is to create something similar to (but better than) one of those skylines.

            3.1 - Core Functionality 
        
                Make a webpage that contains at least 3 skyscrapers in the skyline - and the skyscrapers must have windows! 
                
                Keep the shapes simple - boxes are fine. 

                The webpage should have different lighting depending on the time of day.

                You should be able to control the time of day by pressing some buttons on the page. 
                It should be able to cycle through these states:
                    - morning
                    - day
                    - evening
                    - night
                    - midnight

                In the morning, the city is slowly lighting up. The sky is a gold colour. 
                The building lights are off, and you can see the colours of the buildings (eg. gray) clear in the light.
                Street lights are off.

                During the day, the sky is a light blue. Otherwise it's the same as the morning.

                In the evening, the sky is going orange. Some street lights are turning on and some building lights are going on. 
                Otherwise it's the same as morning/day. 

                At night, the city is dark. The sky is a blue-black colour, the buildings are black and have lights on in some of their windows.
                There might even be some street lights on near the bottom of the buildings.
                There's a big full moon in the background of the city, too.

                After midnight, the city is completely asleep. Lights are off, everything is dark. 
                There's a big full moon in the background of the city - it's the only light right now.

            3.2 - OPTIONAL! Randomized Buildings 
                This might require an overhaul on how you've built your buildings.
                Every time the page is refreshed, the buildings will be different.
                These things should be different:
                    - building size
                    - number of rows for the windows in buildings
                    - number of columns for the windows in buildings
                    - the amount of windows in each building (you may need blank/invisible window spaces to keep things working nicely)
                    - the colour of the buildings
