CHALLENGE 2: Movie Review Terminal App

Create a little NodeJS terminal app that shows the ratings of a movie from the Open Movie Database API.
You should be able to prompt the user for a movie name, and then pass the user's desired movie name into the URL that you fetch data from.

You can check out the Open Movie Database API & documentation here: https://www.omdbapi.com/

This challenge requires you to install a NodeJS package so that you can use Javascript's new "fetch" functionality in the Node terminal.
In your working directory, run this command:

npm i node-fetch

So an example of the app in action:
"What movie would you like to see?"
// user enters "Avengers"
// the app fetches from the API URL
"The movie with the title of 'The Avengers' has a MetaCritic score of 69 and an IMDB rating of 8.0."

You can use the code below to start off with fetch ready for your NodeJS app:

*/
const fetch = require("node-fetch");


console.log("What movie would you like to see?")
const movieChoice = process.stdin.setEncoding("utf-8")
movieChoice.on("data", (movie) => {
    return movieSearch(movie);
})

function movieSearch(movie){
fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=823dba26&t=${movie}`)
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(`This movie'${data.Title}' has a MetaCritic score of ${data.Metascore} and an IMDB rating of ${data.imdbRating}.`))
.catch(err => console.log(err));
}
