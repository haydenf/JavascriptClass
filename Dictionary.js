CHALLENGE 3.1: Your Own Dictionary - JS Edition

Yes, we did this back in Ruby. You must create a Dictionary class that contains:
- an array of words
- but each word should be an object that contains the word and its definition
- functions in the Dictionary class that can add words
- functions in the Dictionary class that can remove words
- functions in the Dictionary class that can update words
- functions in the Dictionary class that can show a specific word if it exists in the array

    removeWords(){

    updateWords(){
